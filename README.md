# Attendance-Automation

We have automated the whole attendance taking process using powerful face recognization library. We don't need to train the model using traditional ML algo with millions of data,We just need one single picture per person for taking the attendance. We have written the code most cleanest way we possibly could so that everybody can understand. dlib is required for importing the face recognization library.

The model can be run by running the start.py python file
